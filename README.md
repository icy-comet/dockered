### Notes
- I store all necessary data under `docker_volumes` directory in my home folder.
- The repo refers to the containers and configs managed/created with docker-compose together as stack, similar to Portainer. So each sub-dir in the repo is a stack.
- Some of the files might not work on Windows or Mac OS.
- This is a work-in-progress project mainly created for personal use.
